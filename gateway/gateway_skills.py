"""Skill discovery / slug-derivation helpers extracted from gateway/run.py.

Round 5 of gateway decomposition. Derives the /command slug from a skill's
frontmatter and checks whether an unknown command maps to a known-but-inactive
skill. No gateway instance state. Note: Path(__file__).parent.parent still
resolves to the repo root from this module's location in gateway/.
Names kept identical to originals so call sites are unchanged.

    Matches the exact normalization used by
    :func:`agent.skill_commands.scan_skill_commands` so the slug here is the
    same string a user types after the leading ``/`` (e.g. a skill with
    frontmatter ``name: Stable Diffusion Image Generation`` resolves to
    ``stable-diffusion-image-generation`` — NOT the parent directory name,
    which is commonly shorter/different, e.g. ``stable-diffusion``).

    Using the directory name silently broke :func:`_check_unavailable_skill`
    for every skill whose directory name drifted from its frontmatter name
    (19 such skills on a standard install as of 2026-05), causing a generic
    "unknown command" response where a "disabled — enable with …" or
    "not installed — install with …" hint was expected.

    Returns ``(slug, declared_name)`` or ``(None, None)`` when the file
    can't be read or lacks a ``name:`` in its frontmatter.
