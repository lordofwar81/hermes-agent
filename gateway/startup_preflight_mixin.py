"""Startup pre-flight checks for ``GatewayRunner``.

Round 46 of the god-file decomposition. This is the first extraction
done under integration-test coverage (via tests/gateway/_runner_harness.py)
rather than the verbatim AST-lift protocol that exhausted itself on the
purely-mechanical method lifts in rounds 1-45.

``_run_startup_preflight_checks`` is the sequence of best-effort
initialization guards that ``start()`` runs before the platform-connect
loop. Each block is independent and swallows its own exceptions — a
problem in any one (routing config, systemd timing, plugin discovery,
shell-hook registration, crash recovery, session suspension, stuck-loop
detection) must NOT block gateway startup; the gateway degrades to the
relevant fallback. The sequence ends with stuck-loop detection; the
``_startup_restore_*`` state setup that directly feeds the connect loop
stays inline in ``start()``.

This is a sub-region extraction, not a verbatim method lift: ``start()``
calls ``self._run_startup_preflight_checks()`` in place of the inline
region. The new tests/gateway/test_startup_preflight.py exercises the
region end-to-end (construct a real runner, stub _create_adapter, call
``await runner.start()``) and asserts both that raising blocks are
swallowed and that a specific side effect fires.

``self.*`` references resolve unchanged via the MRO. Behavior-neutral
extraction matching the existing mixin pattern.

``gateway.run`` module-level runtime symbols (``logger``,
``_hermes_home``) are lazy-imported at the top of the method body to
avoid the circular import (``gateway.run`` imports this mixin at module
top). Stdlib (``os``) is imported at module top. Every other name in
the body is either an in-body lazy import (kept verbatim from source) or
a ``self.*`` reference.
