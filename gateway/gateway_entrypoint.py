"""Gateway process entrypoint — round 57 of the gateway god-file decomposition.

Extracts the process-level entrypoint cluster from gateway/run.py:
  - ``_run_planned_stop_watcher`` (87ln) — background thread that polls the
    planned-stop marker and drives shutdown on platforms without signal support
  - ``_start_cron_ticker`` (93ln) — background thread that fires scheduled jobs
    and runs periodic cleanup (image cache, expired pastes, curator)
  - ``start_gateway`` (456ln) — the main async entrypoint: duplicate-instance
    guard (--replace), PID-file claim, signal-handler install, MCP discovery,
    runner.start(), cron ticker, shutdown wait, clean teardown
  - ``main`` (30ln) — the CLI ``__main__`` wrapper (argparse + start_gateway)

These are module-level free functions (not methods), so this is NOT a mixin
extraction. The functions move verbatim; gateway.run keeps re-export shims
(``from gateway.gateway_entrypoint import start_gateway, main,
_run_planned_stop_watcher, _start_cron_ticker``) so existing imports
(``from gateway.run import start_gateway`` in hermes_cli/gateway.py) and
test patches (``monkeypatch.setattr("gateway.run.start_gateway", ...)`` in
test_gateway_service.py) keep resolving. The re-export shim pattern preserves
patchability because hermes_cli/gateway.py imports start_gateway at call time
(deferred import inside run_gateway), so it picks up the patched attribute.

``gateway.run`` module-level symbols (``logger``, ``_hermes_home``,
``_ensure_windows_gateway_venv_imports``, ``_gateway_loop_exception_handler``)
are lazy-imported at the top of the functions that use them, to avoid the
circular import (``gateway.run`` imports this module at module top).
Stdlib and third-party top-level imports are at module top. Behavior-neutral
extraction matching the existing decomposition pattern (rounds 42-55).

    """Poll for the planned-stop marker and trigger graceful shutdown.

    On Windows, ``asyncio.add_signal_handler`` raises NotImplementedError
    for SIGTERM/SIGINT, so the standard signal-driven shutdown path
    never runs when ``hermes gateway stop`` signals the gateway. The
    consequence is that the drain loop is skipped — in-flight agent
    sessions are killed mid-turn and ``resume_pending`` is never set,
    so the next gateway boot has no idea those sessions need to be
    auto-resumed (issue #33778, v0.13.0 session-resume feature broken
    on native Windows).

    This watcher runs on every platform (cheap, defensive) and bridges
    the gap on Windows by translating a filesystem marker into the
    same shutdown-handler invocation a real SIGTERM would have produced
    on POSIX. The CLI's ``hermes_cli.gateway_windows.stop()`` writes
    the marker via ``write_planned_stop_marker(pid)`` and then waits
    for the gateway PID to exit; this watcher is what makes that
    exit happen cleanly.

    On POSIX this is a no-op safety net — the signal handler always
    races us to consuming the marker file because it fires synchronously
    from the kernel's signal delivery.

    Args:
        stop_event: cleared by start_gateway() during normal shutdown
            to tell the watcher to exit.
        runner: the GatewayRunner instance; we check ``_running`` and
            ``_draining`` to avoid triggering shutdown if the gateway
            is already in one of those states.
        loop: the asyncio event loop the shutdown handler must run on.
        shutdown_handler: same callable that's wired to SIGTERM —
            tolerates a ``None`` signal argument (planned stop case)
            and consumes the marker via
            ``consume_planned_stop_marker_for_self()``.
        poll_interval: seconds between marker checks. 0.5s gives a
            responsive shutdown without burning CPU.
