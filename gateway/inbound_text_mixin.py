"""Inbound message text preparation for ``GatewayRunner``.

Round 45 of the god-file decomposition. Lifted verbatim from
gateway/run.py into gateway/inbound_text_mixin.py.

``_prepare_inbound_message_text`` prepares inbound event text for the
agent, keeping the normal inbound path and the queued follow-up path on
the same preprocessing pipeline so sender attribution, image enrichment,
STT, document notes, reply context, and @ references all behave the same.

Side effect: buffers per-session native image paths when the active model
supports native vision AND the user has images attached. The caller
consumes and clears that session-scoped buffer at the ``run_conversation``
site to build a multimodal user turn. When the list is empty, the
``_enrich_message_with_vision`` text path has already run and images are
represented in-text.

It applies (in order): sender prefix for shared multi-user sessions;
channel-context backfill prepend; media-URL routing (native vision vs
text-mode vision_analyze, voice/audio STT with transcript echo and STT
failure messaging, audio-file-attachment notes, video-attachment notes,
document-context notes); reply-to pointer injection; and @ context
reference expansion (which can block a turn when injection is refused).

``self.*`` references resolve unchanged via the MRO. Behavior-neutral
lift matching the existing mixin pattern.

``gateway.run`` module-level runtime symbols (``logger`` and the
run.py-defined free functions ``_load_gateway_config`` and
``_resolve_runtime_agent_kwargs``) are lazy-imported at the top of the
method body to avoid the circular import (``gateway.run`` imports this
mixin at module top). Stdlib (``os``, ``re``), typing symbols
(``Any``, ``Dict``, ``List``, ``Optional``), and the non-circular module
symbols — ``MessageEvent`` / ``MessageType`` (from
gateway.platforms.base), ``SessionSource`` /
``is_shared_multi_user_session`` (from gateway.session),
``_build_document_context_note`` (from gateway.gateway_message_builders),
``_decide_image_input_mode`` / ``_enrich_message_with_vision`` /
``_thread_metadata_for_source`` / ``_has_setup_skill`` (from
gateway.gateway_message_pipeline / gateway.gateway_gateway_env) — are
imported at module top. ``to_agent_visible_cache_path`` (as
``_to_agent_path`` and under its real name), ``mimetypes`` (as
``_mimetypes``), ``preprocess_context_references_async``, and
``get_model_context_length`` stay as in-body imports (already lazy in
source) and are kept verbatim.
